# euan-4.0
Euan 4.0 is a personal discord bot that I'm making just for fun. I'm mainly using this [guide](https://discordjs.guide).

## Cloning
If you clone this repository for your own bot, you'll want to make sure the ignored files from `.gitignore` are included in your version of the bot. 

For `config.json` you'll want something along the lines of:
```
{
	"clientId": "000000000000000000",
	"guildId": "000000000000000000",
	"token": "aaa0a00a0a00a000a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a0a00a0a0a",
	"prefix": "-"
}
```

The IDs and token will change depending on your discord bot client which should be found [here](https://discord.com/developers/)

I haven't implemented anything using a prefix yet because i'm relying on slash commands for now.
